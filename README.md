# Pressure Monitoring and Alarm System

This project implements a simple pressure monitoring and alarm system using embedded programming. The system reads pressure values from a pressure sensor and activates an alarm if the pressure value exceeds a certain threshold.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **Pictures**: Contains images related to the project.
- **Report**: Contains the project report detailing the system's design, implementation, and results.
- **linker_script**: Contains the linker script used for memory layout.
- **object_file**: Stores compiled object files.
- **output_project**: Contains the executable output of the project.
- **proteus**: Contains a Proteus simulation project for testing the system's behavior.
- **src**: Contains the source code files for the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Modify the necessary files, such as the linker script, startup code, and makefile, as required for your specific microcontroller and development environment.
3. Build and compile the project using the provided makefile.
4. Run the compiled executable on your target hardware or in the Proteus simulation, if applicable.

## Prerequisites

- Install arm_none_eabi_gcc.exe to execute the provided Makefile for compilation and building.

## Usage

Describe how to run the project on actual hardware or in the simulation environment.

```bash
# Compile the project
make

# Run the compiled executable
./output_project/Pressure_Detection
```
